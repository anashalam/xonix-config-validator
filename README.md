# xonix-config-validator
The Xonix Config Validator (XCV) is a blazing-fast CLI tool that eliminates runtime configuration errors. It enforces your Zod schemas against all config files (JSON, YAML, .env), ensuring type safety and constraints are met before deployment. Stop configuration chaos—validate your project's integrity at the build step, not in production.
